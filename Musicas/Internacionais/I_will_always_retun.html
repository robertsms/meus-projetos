    <h1>I will Always Return</h1>
    <h2>Bryan Adams</h2>
    <pre>
        I hear the wind call your name
        It calls me back home again
        It sparks up the fire, a flame that still burns
        It's to you I will always return
    </pre>
    <pre>
        I know the roal is long
        But where you are is long
        Wherever you stay
        I'll find the way
    </pre>
    <pre>
        I'll run like the river
        I'll follow the sun
        I'll fly like an eagle
        to where I belong
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Can't stand the distance
        I can't dream alone
        I can't wait to see you
        Yes, I'm on my way home
    </pre>
    <pre>
        And now I know it's true
        My every road leads to you
        And in the hour of darkness
        Your light gets me through
    </pre>
    <pre>
        You run like the river
        You shine like the sun (yeah)
        You fly like an eagle
        Yeah, you are the one
        I've seen every sunset
        And with all that I've learned
        It's to you, I will always return
    </pre>
